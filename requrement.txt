Hospital Management System (HMS) - Business Requirements Document
Executive Summary
A multi-tenant, cloud-enabled Hospital Management System enabling hospitals to self-register, manage operations, and maintain complete patient lifecycle
management with role-based access control.
1. Product Overview
1.1 Vision
Build a comprehensive, scalable, multi-tenant SaaS platform that enables hospitals of any size to digitize their operations with zero upfront infrastructure investment.
1.2 Objectives
Enable hospitals to self-onboard and become operational within 24 hours.
Enable a multi-tenant solution so that data of each hospital (tenant) is private to them without need of separate infrastructure.
1.3 Target Users
Hospital Administrators: Onboarding, configuration, user management
Doctors: Patient management, prescriptions, diagnostics
Nurses: Patient care, vital monitoring
Pharmacists: Prescription fulfillment
Receptionists: Appointment and patient registration handling

"Patients": {
"permission": "PATIENT:READ",
"icon": "people",
"children": {

3. Technical Architecture
3.1 Architecture Overview
The system follows a modular monolithic architecture, designed for flexibility and scalability. Each functional area — Authentication, User Management, Patient
Management, and Prescription Management — operates as a distinct module within a unified application context.
This architecture ensures:
Better maintainability and performance
Easier deployment compared to distributed microservices
Tenant-based data isolation through middleware
Centralized authentication and role-based authorization
Use of Redis for caching and session optimization

Excellent — that’s a strong and clear instruction  Here’s a refined and professional version of your statement that you can include in your team or project guidelines,

Instruction to Participants / Developers
You are allowed to use AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or other code assistants) to support your development process.
However, you must not simply copy-paste AI-generated code or content.
You are expected to:
Understand every line of the code or content you include in your project.
Be able to explain the logic, flow, and purpose of all functionalities implemented.
Debug, extend, or refactor your work independently if needed.
Use AI responsibly — as a tool for learning, ideation, and assistance, not as a shortcut to submission.
Ensure that the final implementation reflects your own understanding and reasoning.
⚠ Note: During evaluation or review, you may be asked to demonstrate and explain specific parts of your work to confirm ownership and comprehension.
Failure to do so will lead to disqualificatio
